Track baby feeding, peeing and poop times.

## Description
Keep track of your baby's latest activity. 
These activities include feeding, peeing, pooping, exercise and medication taken.
Typically those activities are monitored as irregularities in these can inform doctors or care givers to take a closer look at a babyâ€™s development.
This app will help you and your partner to quickly keep track of your baby, to ensure your peace of mind.
If necessary, all logged activity data can be exported as a csv file and shared with a medical practitioner.
